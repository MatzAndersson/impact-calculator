To start the development server, run:

```bash
python3 run.py
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000/ in your browser. This will render the contents
of index.html within the contents of template.html, which contains setup for
development (e.g. viewport meta tag) but should not be copied when adding code
to Squarespace.
